# services/testing

Shared helpers for the test suite.

This directory is on the Python path via `pyproject.toml`
(`pythonpath = ["services"]`), so tests import as
`from testing.yaml_assertions import assert_yaml_equal_except`.

## Modules

- `yaml_assertions.py` — pure-function YAML structural assertions, safe for
  every tier (unit included).

## Why under `services/` and not a top-level `tests/`?

Imports across the codebase resolve relative to `services/` (see
`CLAUDE.md` → "Python Import Patterns"). Putting helpers here means tests
import without path-munging hacks, the same way services do `from util
import …`.

The Bun service auto-discovery in `platform/src/util/describe-modules.ts`
skips this directory because it has no `testing.py` index file.
