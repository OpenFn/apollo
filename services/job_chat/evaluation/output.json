It does this by calling the function,\npassing in the latest state, and using the return as the value.\n\nThese lazy functions are incredibly powerful. Using them effectively is the key\nto writing good OpenFn jobs.## The Lazy State Operator\n\n:::tip Experimental Feature\n\nThe Lazy State operator is new to OpenFn as of April 2024. It is still\nconsidered an experimental feature.

Or you can raise an issue on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/openfn/kit/issues).\n\n:::\n\nThe Lazy State Operator is a shorthand syntax that makes it easier to read state\nwhen passing data into an operation.\n\nInstead of writing `state.data` to access something on state, you can use `$`,\nlike this:",

It calls the `post` function, passing in a string and whatever sits on\n`state.data`, and returns a function to be executed later. But the two arguments\nhave already been resolved to values.\n\nCalling an operation is a bit like declaring a contract: you specify what you\nwant to happen, and in what order, and what the terms of the contact are. Then\nOpenFn will go off and fulfill the terms of that contract for you.\n\nThe problem is that when you specify the terms of the contract, you don't have\nall the values to hand.

Beyond its core CRM product, Salesforce offers a customizable\nplatform for configuring relational databases, business automation, web portals,\nreporting tools, and robust applications for supporting a wide range of use\ncases.### Data Model\n\nAt its core, Salesforce is a relational database. It has some out-of-box or\n\"standard\" data tables and features, but can be easily extended to include\n\"custom\" metadata configuration and other app features.\n\nSalesforce data is stored in **individual records (rows)** and organized within\n**objects (tables)**. Record attributes are captured in **fields (columns)**.\nThe data model is configurable, but there are some standard objects that are\nprovided. Note that naming conventions for custom and standard metadata may\ndiffer (e.g., all \"custom\" field names include the suffix `__c` like\n`CustomField__c`).\n\nLearn more about how data is structured in Salesforce at the links below:\n\n- How data is organized in Salesforce:\n  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.basics_organize_data.htm&type=5\n- Salesforce objects: https://www.salesforcetutorial.com/salesforce-objects/",

You can re-declare a\n  `var` multiple times.\n- `let` is basically the same as a var, but cannot be redeclared and has subtly\n  different scoping rules.\n- `const` is used for variable whose values do not change.\n\nIt doesn't really matter which style you use (except perhaps if you try to\nassign to a `const`).\n\nMost OpenFn jobs are written in quite a functional style anyway - you may find\nyou don't even need to declare variables.\n\n\nWhat is functional programming?\nFunctional programming is a style of programming, increasingly popular in modern Javascript.\n\nBroadly, the idea is to minimize the usage of control flow statements (like\n`if/else`,`for`) and instead use chains of functions.

Rest API:** The FHIR specification includes a REST API that enables external services like OpenFn to pull data from the FHIR server, or push data from external apps to FHIR servers.

See [functions](/adaptors/packages/fhir-docs) for more on how to use this adaptor to work with the API.\n\n**2. Webhook:** The FHIR specification does not inherently define a webhook or data-forwarding mechanism. However, many FHIR implementations and platforms offer extensions or configurations that support similar functionality. This option is suited for real-time, event-based data integration. Check out the FHIR `Subscription` resource [documentation](https://build.fhir.org/subscription-definitions.html) to learn more about one way this might be implemented.",
