It's designed to facilitate interoperability between different healthcare systems.\n\nTo use FHIR with OpenFn, you would typically:\n\n1. Use the `@openfn/language-fhir` adaptor to interact with FHIR-compliant systems\n2. Create jobs that perform operations like querying patients, creating observations, or updating resources\n\nA basic FHIR job might look like:\n\n```js\nget('Patient', {\n  query: { identifier: 'ABC123' }\n});\n\nfn(state => {\n  // Process the returned patient data\n  console.log(state.data);\n  return state;\n});\n\n// Create a new observation\ncreate('Observation', {\n  status: 'final',\n  code: {\n    coding: [{\n      system: 'http://loinc.org',\n      code: '8867-4',\n      display: 'Heart rate'\n    }]\n  },\n  subject: {\n    reference: `Patient/${state.data.id}`\n  },\n  valueQuantity: {\n    value: 80,\n    unit: 'beats/minute'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor more details, check the [FHIR adaptor documentation](https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors/packages/fhir-docs)."
