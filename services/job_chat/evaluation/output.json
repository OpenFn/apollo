They can be integrated with external tools\nor APIs to execute actions beyond text-based outputs.## Use OpenFn + LLMs for AI-Driven Workflows\n\nWhile LLMs (like Claude or ChatGPT) can generate insights, recommendations, or\nstructured data, they often **lack direct execution capabilities**—meaning they\nneed an automation system to act on their outputs.\n\n**OpenFn workflows fill this gap by orchestrating actions based on LLM-generated\nresponses.**\n\nRemember that LLMs are imperfect.

Run `state` is typically limited to `10MB` and you should therefore\nkeep your payloads well below that limit.## Receiving data from OpenFn\n\nTo make it easy for users to connect to your application, it's highly\nrecommended that you create a language-package with your required authentication\nand a set of simple, allowable actions nicely abstracted into \"helper\nfunctions\". See [language-dhis2](https://www.github.com/openfn/language-dhis2)\nfor an example of a language-package which creates a simpler interface for a\ntraditional JSON-based REST api. Adaptors are written in Javascript and execute\nin Node. You can convert OpenFn's JSON into XML, or any other format before\nsending it to your application and you may make use of any node modules you'd\nlike. See\n[language-postgresql](https://www.github.com/openfn/language-postgresql) for an\nexample of an adaptor that connects directly to PostgreSQL databases using a\npopular NPM module called \"pg\".\n\nTo receive data from OpenFn's generic `language-http` adaptor, your application\nmust allow either basic, token, or digest authenticated POST, PUT, or GET",

It enables supply chain management, providing visibility and accuracy in inventory tracking, order management, and reporting.## Integration Options\n\n**Rest API:** OpenLMIS has a REST API that enables external services like OpenFn to pull data from OpenLMIS, or push data from external apps to OpenLMIS. This option is suited for scheduled, bulk syncs or workflows that must update data in OpenLMIS with external information. See [functions](/adaptors/packages/openlmis-docs) for more on how to use this adaptor to work with the API.",

See this adaptor's [Configuration docs](/adaptors/packages/openmrs-configuration-schema) for more on the required authentication parameters.\n\nSee platform docs on [managing credentials](documentation/manage-projects/manage-credentials) for how to configure a credential in OpenFn. If working locally or if using a Raw JSON credential type, then your configuration will look something like this:```\n{\n  \"instanceUrl\": \"http://openmrs.com/instance/url\",\n  \"password\":\"test\",\n  \"username\":\"test\"\n}\n```### Helpful Links\n\n1.
