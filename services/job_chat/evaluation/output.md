# what is state
State is a special object that flows through your OpenFn workflow. It contains:

- `data`: The main JSON data you're working with
- `references`: History of all previous operations

Think of state as a container that gets passed from one operation to the next. Each operation can read from state and modify it before passing it along.

In your workflow, `fn(s => s)` is simply taking the current state and returning it unchanged.

When you perform operations like `create()` or `query()`, they modify state by adding data or references, which can then be used by later operations in your workflow.

# what does $ mean
In OpenFn jobs, `$` is a shorthand for accessing the state object. It's often called the "lazy state operator" because it provides a simpler way to reference values in the state.

Instead of writing:
```js
get(state => state.data.url)
```

You can use the shorter syntax:
```js
get($.data.url)
```

The `$` symbol ensures the value is resolved at the correct time during execution. You can use it to read from state in various contexts like within objects, string templates, or when mapping data structures.

# How do I download all items from a collection from a particular day? Like 29th march 2024? See my input for an example of what my keys look like
You can use the `collections.get()` function with a key pattern to filter by date. For your data with keys in the format `YYYYMMDD-ID`, you could do:

```js
collections.get('my-collection', '20240329*').then(state => {
  // Now state.data contains all items with keys starting with 20240329
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

This pattern will match any key that starts with "20240329" (March 29th, 2024). You can also use the `createdAfter` and `createdBefore` options if you need to filter by when the items were created rather than their key patterns.

# can you fill out this code for me?
I'll fill out this code to create a FHIR patient resource and add it to a bundle. Here's the complete code:

```js
fn(state => { 
  const input = state.data; // take the input from state.data
  
  // Create a FHIR patient
  state.patient = {
    resourceType: "Patient",
    id: "example-patient",
    identifier: [{
      system: "http://sys-ids.kemkes.go.id/patient/example",
      value: "patient-001"
    }],
    active: true,
    name: [{
      use: "official",
      family: "Example",
      given: ["Patient"]
    }],
    gender: "male",
    birthDate: "1990-01-01"
  };
  
  return state;
});

fn(state => {
  // Create a new FHIR bundle
  state.bundle = {
    resourceType: "Bundle",
    type: "transaction",
    entry: [{
      resource: state.patient,
      request: {
        method: "PUT",
        url: `Patient/${state.patient.id}`
      }
    }]
  };
  
  return state;
});

// Add to bundle and upload (optional final step)
addToBundle(state => state.patient);
uploadBundle();
```

This code will:
1. Create a FHIR patient resource with sample data
2. Create a FHIR bundle with that patient as an entry
3. Use the built-in FHIR adaptor functions to add the patient to the bundle and upload it

You can modify the patient details based on your actual requirements.

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')"
Your code has a syntax error. You're missing a semicolon after the console.log statement. Here's the corrected version:

```js
fn(state => { 
  state.patient = state.data.patients[0]; 
  return state;
});

fn(state => { 
  console.log(state.patient.name); 
  return state; 
})
```

Additionally, the error suggests `state.patient.name` doesn't exist. This could happen if:
1. `state.data.patients` is empty or undefined
2. `state.data.patients[0]` exists but doesn't have a `name` property

You should add error handling:

```js
fn(state => {
  if (state.data && state.data.patients && state.data.patients.length > 0) {
    state.patient = state.data.patients[0];
  } else {
    console.log("No patients data found");
    state.patient = {}; // provide a default
  }
  return state;
});

fn(state => {
  if (state.patient && state.patient.name) {
    console.log(state.patient.name);
  } else {
    console.log("Patient name not found");
  }
  return state;
})
```

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "fn is not defined"
The problem is that you're using `console.log(state.data)` directly without wrapping it in an `fn()` function.

In OpenFn jobs, you need to use the `fn()` operation to execute JavaScript code. Here's the correct way to write this:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

The `fn()` function takes a callback that receives the current state and must return the state (potentially modified).

# Why does the http result not get written to my state?
In your current code, you're making the HTTP request but not storing the response in your state. The `http.get` function returns an operation that, when executed, fetches data and writes it to state.data - but when used inside an `fn()` block, you need to explicitly handle the response.

Try this instead:

```js
http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');

// Now state.data contains the response
fn(state => {
  console.log(state.data); // To see the data
  return state;
});
```

This code makes the HTTP request first, then uses an `fn()` block to work with the response that's now in state.data.

# would you please write a job for me that creates new datavaluesets under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit
I'll help you create a job that creates a new data value set under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit.

First, let me create a job that will create a data value set. You'll need to modify a few specific values to match your DHIS2 instance:

```javascript
// Create a data value set for Approved School CHP
create('dataValueSets', {
  dataSet: 'REPLACE_WITH_DATASET_ID',  // Replace with your actual dataSet ID
  period: '202405',  // May 2024 - adjust as needed
  orgUnit: 'REPLACE_WITH_ORGUNIT_ID',  // Replace with Approved School CHP ID
  completeDate: '2024-05-15',  // Date the data collection was completed
  dataValues: [
    {
      dataElement: 'REPLACE_WITH_DATA_ELEMENT_ID_1',  // Replace with actual data element ID
      categoryOptionCombo: 'REPLACE_WITH_CATEGORY_OPTION_COMBO_ID',  // Replace if needed
      value: '10',  // Replace with your actual value
    },
    {
      dataElement: 'REPLACE_WITH_DATA_ELEMENT_ID_2',  // Replace with actual data element ID
      categoryOptionCombo: 'REPLACE_WITH_CATEGORY_OPTION_COMBO_ID',  // Replace if needed
      value: '25',  // Replace with your actual value
    }
    // Add more data values as needed
  ]
});
```

You'll need to replace the placeholder values with actual IDs from your DHIS2 instance:
1. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_DATASET_ID` with your dataset ID
2. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_ORGUNIT_ID` with the ID for "Approved School CHP"
3. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_DATA_ELEMENT_ID_1` with your data element IDs
4. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_CATEGORY_OPTION_COMBO_ID` if you need specific category option combos

If you don't know these IDs, you can use the `get` operation first to find them, then use the IDs in your create operation.

# What do I do now?
Right now, you have a very simple job with just the `fn()` function that returns the state unchanged. 

You can:

1. Add more operations to your job to perform transformations or actions on your data
2. Run this job to see what your current state looks like

Since you're using the `common` adaptor, you can use functions like:
- `fn()` to write custom JavaScript
- `each()` to iterate through data
- `dataValue()` to extract data by path

What are you trying to accomplish with this workflow? If you share your goal, I can help you build appropriate job code.

# Can you write a cron code that will trigger at 1am India time?
For a job to trigger at 1am India time (UTC+5:30), you need to use a cron expression with the UTC offset applied:

```
0 0 19 * * *
```

This means:
- 0 seconds
- 0 minutes
- 19 hours UTC (which is 1am in India, UTC+5:30)
- Every day of the month
- Every month
- Every day of the week

When setting this up in the OpenFn platform, you would enter this cron expression in the trigger configuration for your job.

# What is fhir and how do I use it?
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It's designed to facilitate interoperability between different healthcare systems.

To use FHIR with OpenFn, you'll need one of our FHIR adaptors:

1. **Generic FHIR adaptor** (`@openfn/language-fhir`) - Basic adaptor for any FHIR server
2. **Version-specific adaptors** like `@openfn/language-fhir-r4` - Tailored for specific FHIR versions
3. **Implementation Guide-specific adaptors** - Custom adaptors for specific implementations (e.g., Ethiopia FHIR Implementation Guide)

You can interact with FHIR servers using REST API operations to:
- Fetch resources with GET requests
- Create/update resources with POST/PUT requests
- Query for specific data

You'll need to select the appropriate adaptor when creating your job and configure credentials to connect to your FHIR server.

For more information, check out our documentation at: https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors/fhir

# How can I generate a UUID for my data?
To generate a UUID in your job, use the `util.uuid()` function:

```js
fn(state => {
  const id = util.uuid();
  console.log(id); // This will show the UUID in your logs
  return { ...state, data: { ...state.data, id } };
});
```

This will create a UUID and add it to your state.data object under the "id" property. You can change the property name to match your needs.

# I want to download data from a file on sharepoint and upload leads into salesforce. Can you give me an idea how that would work?
To download data from SharePoint and upload it to Salesforce as leads, you'd need a multi-step workflow:

1. First step: Use the MSgraph adaptor to authenticate and download your file from SharePoint
2. Second step: Transform the data into Salesforce format 
3. Third step: Upload the transformed data to Salesforce using the salesforce adaptor

Here's a simplified example:

**Step 1: Download from SharePoint using MSgraph adaptor**
```js
get('/me/drive/items/{fileId}/content');
```

**Step 2: Transform data (assuming the file contains CSV data)**
```js
fn(state => {
  // Parse CSV if needed
  const leads = state.data.map(record => ({
    LastName: record.lastName,
    Company: record.company,
    Email: record.email,
    Phone: record.phone
    // Map other fields as needed
  }));
  
  return { ...state, leads };
});
```

**Step 3: Upload to Salesforce**
```js
bulk(
  "Lead", 
  "insert", 
  state => state.leads,
  { failOnError: true }
);
```

For the SharePoint part, you'll need to set up OAuth authorization as mentioned in the documentation. For file formats, you might need additional parsing depending on whether it's CSV, Excel, or another format.

Is there a specific part of this process you'd like more details on?

# I want to search for all patients with the name on state.name, and for each one, update their location to the value on state.newLocation
I'll help you search for patients by name and update their locations. Here's how:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log("Searching for patients with name:", state.name);
  return state;
});

searchPatient({ q: state => state.name }, state => {
  console.log(`Found ${state.data.results.length} patients matching the search`);
  return state;
});

fn(state => {
  // Save the search results for later use
  const patients = state.data.results;
  return { ...state, patients };
});

each(
  "patients[*]",
  fn(state => {
    console.log(`Updating location for patient: ${state.data.display}`);
    
    // Perform the update for this patient
    return update(
      "patient", 
      state.data.uuid, 
      {
        person: {
          addresses: [
            {
              // Update location information
              // You may need to adjust these address fields based on your OpenMRS configuration
              address1: state.newLocation,
              // Include other required fields for your OpenMRS instance
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    )(state);
  })
);
```

This job will:
1. Search for patients using the name from state.name
2. Log how many matching patients were found
3. Save the patients to state for processing
4. Iterate through each patient and update their location with state.newLocation

You may need to adjust the address fields in the update operation depending on your OpenMRS configuration and how locations are stored in your system.
