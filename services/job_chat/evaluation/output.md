# what is state
`state` is a central concept in OpenFn. It's an object that contains all the data flowing through your workflow and is passed from one operation to the next.

The state object has two primary properties:
- `data`: Contains the main payload or data you're working with
- `references`: An array that holds the history of operations and their results

When you write expressions in your job like `fn(state => {...})`, you're accessing and manipulating this state object. Each operation receives the current state, modifies it, and returns the updated state to the next operation.

For example, in your current job code `fn(s => s)`, you're simply passing the state through without modifying it.

# what does $ mean
In OpenFn jobs, `$` is the "Lazy State Operator" - it's a shorthand way to access values from your state object.

Instead of writing:
```js
get(state => state.data.url)
```

You can simply write:
```js
get($.data.url)
```

The `$` symbol ensures the value is resolved at the correct time during execution. It's essentially passing a path to some part of state, rather than the actual value.

This makes your code more concise and easier to read, especially when you need to access nested data structures.

# How do I download all items from a collection from a particular day? Like 29th march 2024? See my input for an example of what my keys look like
You can use pattern matching combined with date filtering to get items from a specific day. For your keys (which follow the format YYYYMMDD-ID), you can use this approach:

```js
// Get all items from March 29, 2024
collections.get('my-collection', '20240329*');
```

If you need more specific filtering, you can also use the `createdAfter` and `createdBefore` options to filter by when items were created:

```js
// Get items created on March 29, 2024
collections.get('my-collection', {
  createdAfter: '20240329',
  createdBefore: '20240330'
});
```

Remember to store the data in your state if you need to use it later:

```js
collections.get('my-collection', '20240329*').then(state => {
  state.march29Data = state.data;
  return state;
});
```

# can you fill out this code for me?
Here's a complete version of the code that creates a FHIR patient and adds it to a bundle:

```js
fn(state => { 
  const input = state.data; // take the input from state.data
  
  // Create a basic FHIR patient resource
  state.patient = {
    resourceType: "Patient",
    identifier: [
      {
        system: "http://sys-ids.kemkes.go.id/patient/identifier",
        value: "P20240001"
      }
    ],
    active: true,
    name: [
      {
        use: "official",
        text: "Patient Name",
        family: "Family Name",
        given: ["Given Name"]
      }
    ],
    gender: "male",
    birthDate: "1990-01-01"
  };
  
  return state;
});

fn(state => {
  // Create a new FHIR bundle
  state.bundle = {
    resourceType: "Bundle",
    type: "transaction",
    entry: [
      {
        resource: state.patient,
        request: {
          method: "POST",
          url: "Patient"
        }
      }
    ]
  };
  
  return state;
});
```

You'll need to update the patient details with actual data. If you need to upload the bundle to Satusehat, you can add a step using `post()` after these functions.

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')"
There's a syntax error in your code. You're missing a semicolon after the console.log statement in the second function. Here's the corrected version:

```js
fn(state => { state.patient = state.data.patients[0]; return state; });
fn(state => { 
  console.log(state.patient.name); 
  return state; 
});
```

Also, make sure your input data actually contains a `patients` array with at least one object that has a `name` property. The error suggests either `state.patient` or `state.patient.name` is undefined.

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "fn is not defined"
The error occurs because you need to import the `fn` function from the common adaptor before using it. 

Try this code instead:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

The `fn()` function lets you execute custom JavaScript code within your job and must wrap your console.log statement.

# Why does the http result not get written to my state?
The `http.get` call inside your `fn` function doesn't update state because you're not:

1. Properly importing the http module
2. Using the return value from http.get
3. Returning the updated state

Try this instead:

```js
fn(state => {
  return http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')(state);
});
```

Or alternatively:

```js
http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
```

When using the second approach, OpenFn will automatically update state with the response data.

# would you please write a job for me that creates new datavaluesets under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit
I'll help you create a job that creates datavaluesets under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit in DHIS2.

To create a dataValueSet in DHIS2, you'll need:
1. The orgUnit ID for "Approved School CHP"
2. A dataSet ID
3. A period (like a month and year)
4. The dataValues to submit

Here's a basic template for creating a dataValueSet:

```javascript
create('dataValueSets', {
  dataSet: 'YOUR_DATASET_ID',
  completeDate: '2023-10-31', // Date the data was collected/completed
  period: '202310', // Period in YYYYMM format
  orgUnit: 'YOUR_ORGUNIT_ID', // ID for "Approved School CHP"
  dataValues: [
    {
      dataElement: 'ELEMENT_ID_1',
      value: '10', // The actual data value
    },
    {
      dataElement: 'ELEMENT_ID_2',
      value: '20',
    }
    // Add more data elements as needed
  ],
});
```

You'll need to replace the placeholder IDs with the actual IDs from your DHIS2 instance. If you have these values, I can help you complete the job code.

# What do I do now?
You've written a basic job using the `fn()` function, which is a simple way to manipulate state in OpenFn. Right now your function just returns the state unchanged.

To move forward, you can:

1. Run this job to see the current state
2. Modify the job to transform your data
3. Add more operations to your workflow

Here's a slightly more useful example that would log the current state:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log(state);
  return state;
})
```

If you have specific data you want to transform or a specific system you want to connect to, let me know and I can help you build a more complete job.

# Can you write a cron code that will trigger at 1am India time?
To write a cron expression that triggers at 1am India time (IST, which is UTC+5:30), I need to convert to UTC:

1am IST = 7:30pm UTC (previous day)

The cron expression would be:

```
30 19 * * *
```

This translates to: "At 19:30 (7:30 PM) UTC every day", which is 1:00 AM in Indian Standard Time.

# What is fhir and how do I use it?
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare data electronically. It's designed to facilitate interoperability between different healthcare systems.

To use FHIR with OpenFn, you have a few options:

1. Use the generic `fhir` adaptor for basic integrations with any FHIR server
2. Use a version-specific adaptor like `fhir-r4` if you're working with FHIR Release 4
3. Use a custom implementation guide-specific adaptor like `fhir-ndr-et` or `fhir-fr` if you're working with those specific implementations

For integration, there are two main approaches:
- REST API: Use OpenFn to pull data from or push data to a FHIR server
- Subscriptions: Configure FHIR's subscription resource to forward data on specific events

To get started, you'd need to:
1. Install the appropriate FHIR adaptor
2. Configure your credentials to connect to the FHIR server
3. Write jobs using the adaptor's helper functions

Would you like some specific code examples for a particular FHIR integration scenario?

# How can I generate a UUID for my data?
You can use the `util.uuid()` function to generate a UUID. Here's a simple example:

```js
fn(state => {
  const id = util.uuid();
  console.log('Generated UUID:', id);
  return { ...state, data: { ...state.data, id } };
})
```

This will generate a random UUID, log it to the console, and add it to your state data object.

# I want to download data from a file on sharepoint and upload leads into salesforce. Can you give me an idea how that would work?
To download data from SharePoint and upload leads to Salesforce, you'll need a workflow with multiple steps:

1. **Step 1: Download from SharePoint** - Use the HTTP adaptor to fetch your file
```js
// Step 1: Using HTTP adaptor to download from SharePoint
get('https://your-sharepoint-url/path-to-file', 
  http.options()
    .oauth(state.configuration.access_token) // or appropriate auth method
);

// If it's a CSV or Excel file, parse it
fn(state => {
  // Handle parsing depending on file type
  // For CSV example:
  const parsedData = parseCsv(state.data);
  return { ...state, leads: parsedData };
})
```

2. **Step 2: Transform the data** - Map SharePoint data to Salesforce format
```js
// Step 2: Using Common adaptor to transform data
fn(state => {
  const salesforceLeads = state.leads.map(item => ({
    FirstName: item.first_name,
    LastName: item.last_name,
    Email: item.email,
    Company: item.company,
    // Map other fields as needed
  }));
  
  return { ...state, salesforceLeads };
})
```

3. **Step 3: Upload to Salesforce** - Create leads in Salesforce
```js
// Step 3: Using Salesforce adaptor to create leads
create('Lead', state => state.salesforceLeads);
```

This workflow assumes:
- You have appropriate credentials configured for both SharePoint and Salesforce
- The SharePoint file is accessible via a URL
- You've mapped the fields correctly from your source data to Salesforce fields

You may need to adjust the authentication methods and field mappings based on your specific requirements.

# I want to search for all patients with the name on state.name, and for each one, update their location to the value on state.newLocation
I'll help you create a job that searches for patients by name and updates their location. Here's the code:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log("Searching for patients with name:", state.name);
  return state;
});

searchPatient({ q: state => state.name })
.then(state => {
  console.log(`Found ${state.data.results.length} patients`);
  return state;
});

each(
  '$.data.results[*]',
  fn(state => {
    console.log(`Updating patient: ${state.data.display}`);
    return update(
      'patient',
      state.data.uuid,
      {
        person: {
          addresses: [
            {
              preferred: true,
              cityVillage: state.newLocation
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    )(state);
  })
);
```

This job:
1. First logs the search name for debugging
2. Searches for patients using the name from state
3. Logs how many patients were found
4. For each patient in the results:
   - Logs which patient is being updated
   - Updates their location using the patient's UUID and the new location from state
