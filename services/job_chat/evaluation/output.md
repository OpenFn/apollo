> what is state

In OpenFn, "state" refers to a JavaScript object that contains data and information about the current execution context of a job. It's a crucial concept in OpenFn job writing. Here are some key points about state:

1. Data storage: The state object stores the data you're working with in a job. This data can be input from a trigger, output from previous operations, or data you've manipulated within the job.

2. Accessible throughout the job: You can access and modify the state object at any point in your job.

3. Structure: The state object typically has two main properties:
   - state.data: Contains the primary data you're working with.
   - state.references: An array that stores results from previous operations.

4. Immutable updates: When you modify state, you should create a new state object rather than mutating the existing one. This is often done using the spread operator (...) in JavaScript.

5. Passing between operations: Each operation in a job receives the current state and returns a new state, allowing data to flow through your job.

Here's a simple example of how state might be used in a job:

```javascript
fn(state => {
  const newData = { ...state.data, newField: 'some value' };
  return { ...state, data: newData };
});
```

This function takes the current state, adds a new field to the data, and returns a new state object with the updated data.

Understanding and effectively managing state is key to writing efficient and correct OpenFn jobs.
