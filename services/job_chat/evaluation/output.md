# what is state

In OpenFn, `state` is a JavaScript object that contains your data and passes
through each operation in your job. It typically has:

1. `state.data` - Contains your current working data
2. `state.references` - Stores historical information about past operations

Each operation in your job takes the state, does something with it, and returns
the modified state to the next operation. When you use `fn()`, you're directly
manipulating this state object.

For example:

```js
fn((state) => {
  console.log(state.data); // Print current data
  // Make changes to state
  return { ...state, data: { ...state.data, newValue: "hello" } };
});
```

---

# what does $ mean

In OpenFn job code, `$` is a shorthand syntax that refers to the current state
object. It lets you access data from state without writing a full
`state => state.something` function.

For example:

- `$.data` is equivalent to `state.data`
- `$.configuration.token` is equivalent to `state.configuration.token`

When you use it with `get()` like in your code, it's a way to dynamically use
values from your state to construct the URL.

# How do I download all items from a collection from a particular day? Like 29th

march 2024? See my input for an example of what my keys look like Based on your
input, each item has a key with a format like "YYYYMMDD-ID". To get all items
from a specific day, you can use the `query` function with the `where` parameter
to filter by date.

Here's how you can download all items from March 29, 2024:

```js
query("yourCollectionName", {
  where: {
    key: {
      $regex: "^20240329-",
    },
  },
});
```

This will fetch all documents where the key starts with "20240329-", which
corresponds to all items from March 29, 2024.

# can you fill out this code for me?

Here's a more complete version of your code for creating a FHIR patient and
bundle:

```js
fn((state) => {
  const input = state.data; // take the input from state.data

  // Create a FHIR patient resource
  state.patient = {
    resourceType: "Patient",
    identifier: [
      {
        system: "https://fhir.kemkes.go.id/id/nik",
        value: "1234567890123456", // Replace with actual NIK
      },
    ],
    active: true,
    name: [
      {
        use: "official",
        family: "Smith", // Replace with actual family name
        given: ["John"], // Replace with actual given names
      },
    ],
    gender: "male", // Replace with actual gender: male | female | other | unknown
    birthDate: "1990-01-01", // Replace with actual birth date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  };

  return state;
});

fn((state) => {
  // Create a new FHIR bundle containing the patient
  state.bundle = {
    resourceType: "Bundle",
    type: "transaction",
    entry: [
      {
        resource: state.patient,
        request: {
          method: "POST",
          url: "Patient",
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  return state;
});

// To send the bundle to SatuSehat, you would use:
// post('', state.bundle);
```

This code:

1. Creates a basic FHIR patient with required fields
2. Builds a transaction bundle containing that patient
3. Includes a commented line showing how to post the bundle

You'll need to replace the placeholder values with actual patient data from your
input.

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "Cannot read properties of

undefined (reading 'name')" Your code has a syntax error and possibly a data
issue:

1. You're missing a semicolon after `console.log(state.patient.name)`
2. It seems `state.data.patients[0]` might not exist or doesn't have a `name`
   property

Try this corrected version:

```js
fn((state) => {
  // Check if patients array exists and has items
  if (state.data.patients && state.data.patients.length > 0) {
    state.patient = state.data.patients[0];
  } else {
    state.patient = { name: "No patient found" };
  }
  return state;
});

fn((state) => {
  console.log(state.patient.name);
  return state;
});
```

This adds error checking to prevent the undefined error.

# What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "fn is not defined"

The error "fn is not defined" occurs because the code is just using
`console.log(state.data)` directly at the top level without wrapping it in a
function.

In OpenFn jobs, all top-level code must be operations (function calls). Try this
instead:

```js
fn((state) => {
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

This wraps your console.log in the `fn()` operation, which executes your custom
function in the job context.

# Why does the http result not get written to my state?

The HTTP result is not being written to your state because you're not storing
the return value from the HTTP call.

Try this instead:

```js
fn((state) => {
  return http
    .get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then((response) => {
      return { ...state, data: response.body };
    });
});
```

This way, the HTTP response is assigned to `state.data` and returned.

# would you please write a job for me that creates new datavaluesets under the

"Approved School CHP" organization unit I can help you write a job that creates
new dataValueSets under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit. I'll need
some more details to properly customize this for you:

1. Do you know the organization unit ID (not just the name)?
2. Which dataSet are you using?
3. What period are you targeting?
4. What data values do you want to include?

Here's a basic template to get you started:

```javascript
create("dataValueSets", {
  dataSet: "YOUR_DATASET_ID", // Replace with your dataSet ID
  period: "202401", // Replace with your desired period (YYYYMM format)
  orgUnit: "YOUR_ORG_UNIT_ID", // Replace with "Approved School CHP" org unit ID
  dataValues: [
    // Add your data values here, for example:
    dv("DATA_ELEMENT_ID_1", "10"),
    dv("DATA_ELEMENT_ID_2", "20"),
    // Add more as needed
  ],
});
```

Once you provide the specific IDs and values, I can tailor this job more
precisely to your needs.

# What do I do now?

You have a basic job with just a single function `fn(s => s)`, which simply
returns the state without modifying it.

To build a useful workflow:

1. Decide what system you want to interact with and select the appropriate
   adaptor
2. Define what you want your job to do (fetch data, transform it, send it
   somewhere)
3. Write the job code in the editor

Since you're currently using the language-common adaptor, you can:

- Transform data using `fn()`
- Use `each()` to iterate through data
- Process data with standard JavaScript functions

If you need to connect to external systems, you'll want to add steps with
specific adaptors like http, salesforce, dhis2, etc.

What kind of workflow are you trying to build?

# Can you write a cron code that will trigger at 1am India time?

A cron expression that will trigger at 1:00 AM India time (UTC+5:30) would be:

```
30 19 * * *
```

This converts 1:00 AM IST to UTC time (which is 19:30 UTC the previous day).

If you need to include seconds in the cron expression (6-part cron):

```
0 30 19 * * *
```

# Who can see these messages?

These chat sessions are saved to each job, so any user who can see the workflow
can see this chat. The chat panel is embedded in the web-based IDE where users
build workflows.

# What is fhir and how do I use it?

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for healthcare
data exchange developed by HL7. It's designed to facilitate interoperability
between different healthcare systems.

To use FHIR with OpenFn, you would typically:

1. Use the `@openfn/language-fhir` adaptor to interact with FHIR-compliant
   systems
2. Create jobs that perform operations like querying patients, creating
   observations, or updating resources

A basic FHIR job might look like:

```js
get("Patient", {
  query: { identifier: "ABC123" },
});

fn((state) => {
  // Process the returned patient data
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});

// Create a new observation
create("Observation", {
  status: "final",
  code: {
    coding: [
      {
        system: "http://loinc.org",
        code: "8867-4",
        display: "Heart rate",
      },
    ],
  },
  subject: {
    reference: `Patient/${state.data.id}`,
  },
  valueQuantity: {
    value: 80,
    unit: "beats/minute",
  },
});
```

For more details, check the
[FHIR adaptor documentation](https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors/packages/fhir-docs).

# How can I generate a UUID for my data?

You can generate a UUID using JavaScript's built-in crypto module. Here's how:

```javascript
fn((state) => {
  // Generate a random UUID (v4)
  const uuid = ([1e7] + -1e3 + -4e3 + -8e3 + -1e11).replace(/[018]/g, (c) =>
    (
      c ^
      (crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0] & (15 >> (c / 4)))
    ).toString(16)
  );

  console.log("Generated UUID:", uuid);

  return { ...state, uuid };
});
```

This will add the generated UUID to your state object. You can then use it in
subsequent operations.

# I want to download data from a file on sharepoint and upload leads into

salesforce. Can you give me an idea how that would work? For your workflow
integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, you would need a multi-step process:

1. First step: Use the `@openfn/language-http` adaptor to download the file from
   SharePoint

   - Authenticate with SharePoint using OAuth2 or other authentication
   - Make a GET request to download your file

2. Second step: Parse the data using Common adaptor

   - If it's a CSV file, use `parseCsv()`
   - If it's another format, use appropriate parsing functions

3. Third step: Transform the data into Salesforce format

   - Use `fn()` to map fields from your file to Salesforce Lead object format

4. Fourth step: Upload to Salesforce using the current adaptor
   - Use `create('Lead', data)` for new leads or
   - Use `upsert('Lead', 'ExternalId__c', data)` if you need to create or update

Here's a simplified example of what the workflow might look like:

```js
// Step 1: Download the file from SharePoint
get(
  "https://your-sharepoint-url/path/to/file.csv",
  http.options().oauth(state.configuration.access_token)
);

// Step 2: Parse the CSV data
parseCsv(state.data.body);

// Step 3: Transform data for Salesforce
fn((state) => {
  const transformedLeads = state.data.map((row) => ({
    FirstName: row.first_name,
    LastName: row.last_name,
    Email: row.email,
    Company: row.company,
    // Add other fields as needed
  }));

  return { ...state, leads: transformedLeads };
});

// Step 4: Upload to Salesforce
create("Lead", (state) => state.leads);
```

Would you like me to provide more details on any specific part of this process?

# I want to search for all patients with the name on state.name, and for each one,

update their location to the value on state.newLocation You'll need to use
`searchPatient` to find patients matching the name, then `each` through the
results to update each patient's location. Here's how to do it:

```js
searchPatient({ q: (state) => state.name });

each(
  "$.data.results[*]",
  update(
    "patient",
    (state) => state.data.uuid,
    (state) => ({
      person: {
        addresses: [
          {
            location: state.newLocation,
          },
        ],
      },
    })
  )
);
```

This code first searches for patients matching the name in `state.name`, then
for each patient found, updates their location with the value from
`state.newLocation`.
