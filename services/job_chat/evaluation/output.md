> **what is state
State is a JavaScript object that flows through your workflow. It contains:

- `data`: The main data you're working with
- `references`: History of all previous operations

As your workflow runs, each step receives state, modifies it, and passes it to the next step. State is how data moves between steps in your workflow.

In jobs, you can access and modify state with functions like `fn()`:

```js
fn(state => {
  // Access data with state.data
  // Return modified state
  return { ...state, data: { newData: "value" } };
})
```
---
> **what does $ mean
In OpenFn job code, `$` is a shorthand reference to the current state object. It allows you to access data from the state without having to explicitly write a function.

For example, `$.data.url` is equivalent to writing:

```js
function(state) {
  return state.data.url;
}
```

It's commonly used to access values from the state object in a more concise way, especially when referencing data that came from a previous step in your workflow or from the input.

> **How do I download all items from a collection from a particular day? Like 29th
march 2024? See my input for an example of what my keys look like
Your data appears to have keys in the format "YYYYMMDD-ID". To download all items from a specific date like March 29, 2024, you can filter your collection using a query with the `each` function.

Try this code:

```js
fn(state => {
  // Define the target date in your desired format
  const targetDate = '20240329';
  
  // Filter the data to only include items from the target date
  const filteredData = state.data.filter(item => {
    return item.key.startsWith(targetDate);
  });
  
  console.log(`Found ${filteredData.length} items from ${targetDate}`);
  
  // Return the filtered data
  return { ...state, filteredData };
});
```

This will filter your data to only include items where the key starts with "20240329" (March 29, 2024) and store them in `state.filteredData`.

If you need to fetch data from a collection API first, you would combine this with the appropriate Salesforce query operation.

> **can you fill out this code for me?
Here's a complete FHIR patient and bundle implementation for your job:

```js
fn(state => {
  const input = state.data;
  // create a FHIR patient resource
  state.patient = {
    resourceType: "Patient",
    identifier: [
      {
        system: "https://fhir.kemkes.go.id/id/nik",
        value: "1234567890123456" // Replace with actual NIK from input when available
      }
    ],
    active: true,
    name: [
      {
        use: "official",
        text: "John Doe", // Replace with actual name from input when available
        family: "Doe",
        given: ["John"]
      }
    ],
    gender: "male", // Replace with actual gender from input when available
    birthDate: "1990-01-01" // Replace with actual birthdate from input when available
  };
  return state;
});

fn(state => {
  // create a new FHIR bundle with the patient resource
  const bundle = {
    resourceType: "Bundle",
    type: "transaction",
    entry: [
      {
        resource: state.patient,
        request: {
          method: "POST",
          url: "Patient"
        }
      }
    ]
  };
  
  return { ...state, bundle };
});

// To send the bundle to SATUSEHAT
post('', state => state.bundle);
```

You'll need to modify the patient details with actual data from your input when you have it. The code creates a FHIR Patient resource, adds it to a FHIR Bundle as a transaction, and then posts it to SATUSEHAT.
---
> **What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "Cannot read properties of
undefined (reading 'name')"
The code has two issues:

1. Missing semicolon after `console.log(state.patient.name)`
2. You're trying to access data that doesn't exist or isn't in the format you expect

The error means `state.patient` exists but doesn't have a `name` property, or `state.patient` itself is undefined.

Modify your code to check if the values exist before accessing them:

```js
fn(state => { 
  state.patient = state.data && state.data.patients && state.data.patients[0]; 
  return state;
});

fn(state => { 
  if (state.patient) {
    console.log(state.patient.name);
  } else {
    console.log('Patient data not found');
  }
  return state; 
});
```
---
> **What is wrong with this code? I get an error like "fn is not defined"
The error you're seeing is because you're trying to call `console.log(state.data)` directly in your job, but in OpenFn jobs, you need to wrap such statements in a function.

Try using the `fn()` function like this:

```js
fn(state => {
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

The `fn()` function allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript within your job while ensuring that the state is properly passed through the job execution pipeline.
---
> **Why does the http result not get written to my state?
Your code executes the HTTP request but doesn't capture or return the result. Inside your `fn()` function, you need to return the modified state with the HTTP response data.

Try this instead:

```javascript
fn(async state => {
  const response = await http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  return { ...state, data: response.body };
})
```

This executes the GET request and adds the response body to your state under the `data` property.

> **would you please write a job for me that creates new datavaluesets under the
"Approved School CHP" organization unit
I'll help you create a job that creates new datavaluesets under the "Approved School CHP" organization unit.

For this task, I need to know:
1. The dataSet ID you want to use
2. The period for the data
3. The specific dataValues (dataElement IDs and values) you want to include

Here's a template to get you started:

```js
create('dataValueSets', {
  dataSet: 'YOUR_DATASET_ID',
  period: '202401', // Example: January 2024 (format: YYYYMM)
  orgUnit: 'APPROVED_SCHOOL_CHP_ID', // Replace with the actual ID
  dataValues: [
    {
      dataElement: 'DATA_ELEMENT_ID_1',
      value: '10', // Replace with your actual value
    },
    {
      dataElement: 'DATA_ELEMENT_ID_2',
      value: '20', // Replace with your actual value
    }
    // Add more dataValues as needed
  ]
});
```

To use this job effectively, you'll need to:
1. Replace 'YOUR_DATASET_ID' with your actual dataSet ID
2. Replace 'APPROVED_SCHOOL_CHP_ID' with the actual organization unit ID for "Approved School CHP"
3. Replace the dataElement IDs and values with your actual data

You can also get the organization unit ID first if you don't have it:

```js
get('organisationUnits', {
  filter: 'name:eq:Approved School CHP',
  fields: 'id,name'
}).then(response => {
  const orgUnitId = response.data.organisationUnits[0].id;
  
  return create('dataValueSets', {
    dataSet: 'YOUR_DATASET_ID',
    period: '202401',
    orgUnit: orgUnitId,
    dataValues: [
      {
        dataElement: 'DATA_ELEMENT_ID_1',
        value: '10',
      },
      {
        dataElement: 'DATA_ELEMENT_ID_2',
        value: '20',
      }
    ]
  });
});
```
---
> **What do I do now?
You have a basic job set up with just `fn(s => s)`, which passes state through without changes. This is a starting point for building your workflow.

To build a useful workflow:

1. Decide what system you want to interact with (you'll need an appropriate adaptor)
2. Add operations to perform specific tasks with that system

Since you're using the language-common adaptor, you can:
- Transform data with `fn()`
- Process data collections with `each()`
- Extract values with `dataValue()`

What are you trying to accomplish with this workflow? For example:
- Getting data from an API?
- Transforming data?
- Sending data to another system?

> **Can you write a cron code that will trigger at 1am India time?
A cron expression that triggers at 1:00 AM India time (IST, which is UTC+5:30) would be:

```
30 19 * * *
```

This expression means:
- 30 minutes past
- 19 hours UTC (which is 1:00 AM in IST/UTC+5:30)
- Every day of the month
- Every month
- Every day of the week

This converts 1:00 AM IST to UTC time, which is 7:30 PM (19:30) the previous day in UTC.

> **What is fhir and how do I use it?
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It's designed to facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems.

To use FHIR with OpenFn, you would use the FHIR adaptor. This adaptor allows you to interact with FHIR servers to read and write healthcare data.

Here's a simple example of how to fetch a patient resource from a FHIR server:

```js
get('Patient/12345');

fn(state => {
  console.log(state.data);
  return state;
});
```

For more complex operations like creating or updating resources, you'd use operations like:

```js
// Create a new patient
post('Patient', {
  resourceType: 'Patient',
  name: [{ 
    use: 'official',
    family: 'Smith', 
    given: ['John'] 
  }],
  gender: 'male',
  birthDate: '1970-01-01'
});

// Update a patient
put('Patient/12345', {
  resourceType: 'Patient',
  id: '12345',
  name: [{ 
    use: 'official', 
    family: 'Smith', 
    given: ['John', 'Q'] 
  }]
});
```

You would need to install and select the FHIR adaptor for your job to use these operations.
---
> **How can I generate a UUID for my data?
You can use JavaScript's UUID generation capabilities in your job. Add this to your code:

```js
fn(state => {
  const uuid = crypto.randomUUID();
  return { ...state, data: { ...state.data, uuid } };
})
```

This adds a `uuid` field to your `state.data` object. If you want to generate UUIDs for multiple items, you can use `each()` or `map()` to iterate through collections.
---
> **I want to search for all patients with the name on state.name, and for each one, update their location to the value on state.newLocation
I'll help you write a job to search for patients by name and update their location. Here's the code:

```javascript
fn(state => {
  console.log("Searching for patients with name:", state.name);
  return state;
});

searchPatient({ q: state => state.name });

fn(state => {
  console.log(`Found ${state.data.results.length} patients`);
  return state;
});

each(
  '$.data.results[*]',
  fn(state => {
    const patient = state.data;
    console.log(`Updating patient ${patient.uuid} to location ${state.newLocation}`);
    
    return { ...state, patientId: patient.uuid };
  })
);

fn(state => {
  // Check if any patients were found and processed
  if (!state.references[1].data.results.length) {
    console.log("No patients found to update");
  }
  return state;
});
```

You'll need to ensure your state has both `name` and `newLocation` properties before running this job. Note that this job logs information about the patients found but doesn't actually perform the update yet. To implement the update part, we would need to know which field in OpenMRS stores the location information.

Could you let me know which exact patient field should be updated with the new location?
