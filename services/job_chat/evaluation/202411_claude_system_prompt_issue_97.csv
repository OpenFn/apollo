What is Mogli and how does it send messages?,"I don't have specific information about Mogli or how it sends messages. The OpenFn Google Sheets adaptor we're discussing is used for interacting with Google Sheets spreadsheets, not for sending messages. It provides functions for reading from and writing to Google Sheets. 

If you need to send messages as part of your workflow, you may want to look into a different adaptor or service that provides messaging capabilities. OpenFn has adaptors for various systems, but I don't have information about a specific Mogli adaptor.

Is there something specific you're trying to accomplish with Google Sheets? I'd be happy to help with Google Sheets related operations if that's what you need.",v2,False
How does MojaTax handle tax management?,"I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about how MojaTax handles tax management. MojaTax is not a system I have definitive knowledge about. 

The question you've asked is not directly related to writing OpenFn jobs or using the Google Sheets adaptor. Is there perhaps a different question you meant to ask about using Google Sheets with OpenFn? I'd be happy to try to assist with that.

If you do need information about a specific tax management system, I'd recommend checking that system's official documentation or contacting their support team for accurate details.",v2,False
