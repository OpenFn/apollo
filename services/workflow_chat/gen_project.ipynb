Rest API: Asana has an available REST API that enables external services like OpenFn to pull data from Asana, or push data from external apps to Asana. This option is suited for scheduled, bulk syncs or workflows that must update data in Asana with external information. See [functions](/adaptors/packages/asana-docs) for more on how to use this adaptor to work with the API.\\n\\n2. Webhook: Asana also has a [Webhook or Data Forwarding](https://developers.asana.com/docs/webhooks-guide) to push data from Asana to external systems. This option is suited for real-time, event-based data integration. Check out the Asana [developer documentation](/adaptors/packages/asana-docs) to learn how to set up a webhook to push data to OpenFn.\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nSee [Asana docs](https://developers.asana.com/docs/authentication) for the latest on supported authentication methods. \\n\\nWhen integrating with Asana via OpenFn, there is one primary authentication method that is supported: **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. You can generate a personal access token from the Asana [developer console](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token).\\n\\nSee this adaptor\\'s [Configuration docs](/adaptors/packages/asana-configuration-schema) for more on the required authentication parameters.\\n\\nSee platform docs on [managing credentials](/documentation/manage-projects/manage-credentials) for how to configure a credential in OpenFn.

    "\n",
    "# ## Rules for Edge Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. The first job should always connect to the trigger\n",
    "# 2. Each subsequent job should connect to the previous job with one condition_type: on_job_success, on_job_failure, always or js_expression (for the latter, also add a condition_expression in quotes e.g. \"!state.error\")\n",
    "# 3. For branching workflows, create conditional edges as appropriate\n",

    "- **Webhook**: Use for event-based triggers (default if not specified)\n",

    "6. Job IDs should be derived from their names, replacing spaces with hyphens\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules for Edge Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first job should always connect to the trigger\n",
    "2. Each subsequent job should connect to the previous job with one condition_type: on_job_success, on_job_failure, always or js_expression (for the latter, also add a condition_expression in quotes e.g. \"!state.error\")\n",

    "\n",
    "# ## Rules for Edge Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. The first job should always connect to the trigger\n",
    "# 2. Each subsequent job should connect to the previous job with one condition_type: on_job_success, on_job_failure, always or js_expression (for the latter, also add a condition_expression in quotes e.g. \"!state.error\")\n",
