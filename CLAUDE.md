# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development

- `bun dev` - Start hot-reloading development server (watches TypeScript files)
- `bun start` - Start production server
- `bun test` - Run TypeScript tests
- `bun py <service> <input.json>` - Run Python service directly via entry.py
  (sets up env)

### Python Setup

- `poetry install` - Install main Python dependencies

### Testing Python Services

There are no python tests in the repo at this time.

### Code Quality

- `black services/` - Format Python code (line length: 120)
- `ruff check services/` - Lint Python code with comprehensive rule set

## Architecture

This is a hybrid TypeScript/Python platform that provides AI and data services
for the OpenFn platform and toolchain.

### Server Structure (TypeScript + Bun + Elysia)

- **Entry**: `platform/src/index.ts` â†’ `platform/src/server.ts`
- **Framework**: Elysia web framework running on Bun runtime
- **Middleware**: Health checks, directory listing, Python service bridging
- **Services Bridge**: `/services/<name>` endpoints invoke Python modules via
  child processes

### Python Services Architecture

- **Entry Point**: `services/entry.py` - All Python services invoked through
  this module
- **Service Structure**: Each service is a Python module in `services/<name>/`
  with a `main()` function
- **Invocation Pattern**: `services/<name>/<name>.py` with
  `main(data: dict) -> dict`

### Key Python Services

#### AI & Generation Services

- `job_chat/` - AI chatbot for OpenFn job assistance with RAG
- `workflow_chat/` - AI assistant for OpenFn workflow creation
- `vocab_mapper/` - Maps medical vocabularies (LOINC/SNOMED) using embeddings

#### Embeddings & Search Services

Pinecone is used in production to store embeddings. OpenAI is used to generate
vectors.

The OpenFn docsite docs.openfn.org is embedded and used in search_docsite, which
is utilise by job_chat to dynamically add context to user questions.

- `search_docsite/` - Searches OpenFn documentation using Pinecone vector store
- `embed_docsite/` - Indexes OpenFn documentation for search
- `embeddings/` - Vector embeddings with Pinecone (production index:
  "apollo-mappings")
- `embed_loinc_dataset/` - Preprocesses and embeds LOINC medical codes
- `embed_snomed_dataset/` - Preprocesses and embeds SNOMED medical terminology

#### Utility Services

- `latest_adaptors/` - Retrieves latest adaptor versions
- `status/` - System health and status checks

### Communication Protocols

- **HTTP**: POST requests with JSON payloads
- **WebSocket**: Same URLs as HTTP, provides live log streaming
  - `start` event: Client sends JSON payload
  - `log` event: Server streams Python logger output (not print statements)
  - `complete` event: Server sends final JSON result

### Python Environment

- **Python Version**: 3.11 (exact requirement)
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry with in-project `.venv`
- **Environment Loading**: Uses `.env` file for API keys and configuration
- **Error Handling**: Custom `ApolloError` class with Sentry integration

### Development Patterns

- TypeScript services are minimal - primarily routing and Python process
  management
- Python services follow common patterns but have no strict interface beyond
  `main(data) -> dict`
- When running python services, either call a running server through curl or ust
  entry.py to exercise the environment
- All services expect and return JSON through main
- Logger output (not print statements) streams to WebSocket clients
- API keys loaded from `.env` rather than embedded in payloads

## Important Notes

### Environment Requirements

- **Required API Keys**: OpenAI API key, Pinecone API key (for embedding
  services)
- **Python Environment**: Must use Python 3.11 exactly
- **Vector Store**: Production uses Pinecone index "apollo-mappings" with
  namespace-based collections

### Service Dependencies

- Embedding services use `loinc_store.connect_loinc()` and
  `snomed_store.connect_snomed()` for production data
- Both connect to Pinecone with "apollo-mappings" index
- Medical vocab services depend on pre-embedded LOINC/SNOMED datasets
