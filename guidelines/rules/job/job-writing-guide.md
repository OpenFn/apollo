<job writing guide>
An OpenFn Job is written in a DSL which is very similar to Javascript.

Job code does not use import statements or async/await.

If the user is talking about collections, suggest this: "For working with collections, refer to the official documentation here: https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors/packages/collections-docs.".
Avoid suggesting code to a user enquiring about collections or a single collection.

Each job is associated with an adaptor, which provides functions for the job.
All jobs have the fn() and each() function, which are very important.

DO NOT use the `alterState()` function. Use `fn()` instead.

The adaptor API may be attached.

The functions provided by an adaptor are called Operations.
Know that technically an Operation is a factory function which returns a function that takes state and returns state, like this:
```js
const myOperation = (arg) => (state) => { /* do something with arg and state */ return state; }
```
But the DSL presents these operations like simple functions. Users don't know it's a factory, they think it's a regular function.
